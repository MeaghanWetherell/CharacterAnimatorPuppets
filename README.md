# CharacterAnimatorPuppets
Pre-made puppets for use in Adobe Character Animator. Use them to create animations or to figure out how to set up your own puppets, layer-wise.

The .puppet files are openable in Character Animator. They should come in fully rigged with a few triggers (the iris gets bloodshot eyes, the rstudio globe can puke, etc).
The .ai files are openable in Adobe Illustrator. They are what was used to make the puppets, and if you want to make edits or if you want to see how to set up your layers.

The puppets are as follows:
- Iris, a demonic manifestation of the iris package in R
- RStudio, a cranky RStudio logo who is not impressed by your code (much like RStudio itself)
- Blue Plus, those things that appear in the console when you've failed to end your parentheses correctly. My students find them endlessly infuriating. I call them the blue plus signs of doom.
